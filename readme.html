                It was hard to me to work with the database and menage all the requests and responses from the server.<br>
                I tried to do my best to build this app from scratch while under time pressure and working between exams.<br>
                On this opportunity, I would like to say that this was the biggest project I have done so far in the degree and the most effective one.
                I learned a lot from him and gained a lot of knowledge from the course.
