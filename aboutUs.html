        <h1>About us</h1>
        <p>
            We founded SHOESEE in 2019 after we too

Tired of paying crazy prices for professional quality soccer shoes.

We set off and signed an exclusivity agreement with the main factory

who produces the models you see on our website.

Since then, over 400 satisfied customers have joined us

And among them, the players of the Premier League and the National League who pass the word of mouth.

We are the largest and oldest online store in the field of clothing and footwear

and import the highest quality products available. We have tried every product that appears on our page ourselves!

Beyond the quality of the product and a price worth every pocket,

At SHOESEE it is important to us to provide a professional, reliable and family service,

That's why each of our customers will be able to tell you

That we answer around the clock and do everything to leave every customer with a smile.

This is why most of our orders come from referral customers. ðŸ˜Š
